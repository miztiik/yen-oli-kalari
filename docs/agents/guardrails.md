# Agent Guardrails

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-10

This is the guardrails-only digest every persona must honour. It restates `CLAUDE.md` constraints in one place so an agent can scan the constraints quickly and so other docs (design-rationale sections, agent files, code reviews) can link to specific rules. The authoritative source remains [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md); if this doc and `CLAUDE.md` disagree, `CLAUDE.md` wins and this digest gets updated.

Loaded by [`bootstrap.md`](bootstrap.md) as part of every persona's startup ritual.

Agent/customization Markdown is ASCII-only: write "-", "->", ">=", and "section" instead of fancy symbols.

**Authority assignment** (resolves stalled agent debates). The seven personas live under [`.github/agents/`](../../.github/agents/); each owns one altitude (`CLAUDE.md` section 14):

| Decision class | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Inference runtime / model quantisation and fit / runner budget / throughput / cache and shard economics / job timeouts | **Carmack** (Engine & Runtime) |
| Architecture / persisted contracts (stage payloads, eval ledger, run manifest, config, published payloads) / schema versioning / test tiers / refactor safety / module structure / when to delete | **Fowler** (Architecture & Engineering) |
| Model pick on quality grounds / prompt strategy / constrained decoding / eval design and metric choice / the prompt-injection surface | **Andre** (AI / LLM) |
| The published surface: page and typography, chart vs diagram vs nothing, the eval dashboard, what a visual must earn | **Jony** (UI/UX) |
| Whether a surface is good enough to ship: the sufficiency checks, elevation and colour systems, icon and chart craft, both themes, empty and degraded states | **Susan** (Craft & Delight) |
| What the digest covers and at what length: story selection, where a cut may fall by kind of writing, which themes to trade when a budget binds, whether a source earns its slot | **Editor** |
| Reader reality check (is this worth two minutes? is the language plain? does the page work on a slow connection?) | **Reader** |

Where Carmack and Andre both touch the model: **Andre owns whether a model is good enough, Carmack owns whether it fits.** A model that fails either test is not the pick. Where Andre and Carmack both touch injection: **Andre owns the prompt and schema shape, Carmack owns the process boundary** (no model output becomes a shell argument, a file path, or a URL to fetch). Where Editor and Andre both touch quality: **Editor names the content failure, Andre chooses the instrument that measures it.** Where Editor and Reader both touch content: **Reader reports what reading it was like, Editor rules what should have run.** Where Jony and Susan both touch the page: **Jony rules what survives on the page, Susan rules whether what survived is good enough to ship.** Susan never overrules Carmack on bytes, Reader on plain language, or Editor on what runs.

**A veto must name what the reader loses.** A ruling that removes states what is removed *and* what the reader gives up by not having it; a ruling that states only the first is not a ruling and does not bind. This is not a courtesy. Until 2026-08-29 every persona on this project was a veto and none was a demand, so the published surface converged on the minimum that passed all of them - measured at 40.6 percent of a 1536px screen, with two responsive breakpoints in the entire frontend. Removal was free, so removal won every time. Susan is the counterweight and this clause is the price.

Adding an eighth persona requires a distinct altitude not already covered; two personas at the same altitude collapse into one (`CLAUDE.md` section 14).

**User approval supersedes every agent and every guardrail.**

## Voice (`CLAUDE.md` section 0b)

Binds every persona and every answer an agent gives a user, plus docs, commit messages and reader-facing strings.

- Write in plain, direct language. Use short sentences with one idea each.
- Use the active voice.
- Do not use corporate or self-invented tech jargon.
- Lead with the core answer. Skip all introductory fluff.
- Keep answers short unless asked for depth.
- Say what a number means, next to the number. `1.055x` is not an answer; "5.5 percent faster, and we needed 40 percent" is.
- A term from a subsystem is not a term for a user. Define it in the same sentence or do not use it.
- A third-party product name is not a design vocabulary. Name the artefact and the property, never the vendor whose screenshot it came from. Binds docs, plan-docs, code comments, commit messages, branch names and filenames.
- Use ASD-STE100.

A persona's own worldview shapes what it says, never how plainly it says it.

## Decision requests and tables (`CLAUDE.md` section 0c)

Write every answer in plain, simple English - a person outside this project understands it on one read. No subsystem terms, no invented jargon, no vendor name used as vocabulary. Define any unavoidable term in the same sentence.

When you need the user to choose, ask in one message, in this order: situation, problem, impact, options each with its cost and what it gives up, recommendation naming one option. An option with no cost named is not an option.

Every table in every answer is lettered in the order it appears - `Table A`, `Table B` - and each row's id is that letter plus its number (`A1`, `A2`, `B1`) in the first column. No id repeats in one message, so the user answers `A3` or `A2 and B1` and quotes nothing back.

A message with no options is a status update, not a decision request, and does not use the five-part shape.

## Adaptive Guardrails (cite by number when relevant)

1. **Static-first publication.** What ships to a reader is a static bundle on GitHub Pages. No production backend, no server we run, no runtime call to a model provider, no telemetry SDK, no accounts, no push notifications. Every computation happens in the reader's browser or in CI. Fetching static assets is allowed, third-party ones included - a font, a stylesheet, a charting library - and so is fetching our own committed files at runtime. What is forbidden is a *service*: logic executing off the reader's device, anything reporting a reader's behaviour, and any third-party script that phones home.
2. **The runner is the architecture.** Every pipeline decision is measured against a stock `ubuntu-latest`: 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, no GPU, 6 h per job, 20 concurrent jobs, 10 GB cache per repo, 500 MB artifact storage, and a **1 GB hard cap on the published Pages site**. Minutes are free (public repo), so wall-clock is the constraint. Nothing here is billed, which is why the money figure Guardrail #10 allows on the console is a counterfactual. A model that does not fit is a design error, not a budget request.
3. **Contracts before logic.** Every persisted shape is a Pydantic model in `backend/idhazh/contracts/` before logic reads or writes it; `schemas/` is generated from it.
4. **docs/ = the memory; a decision lives on the page it impacts.** No ADR file, no `docs/architecture/decisions/` directory. A private note store is a cache of `docs/`, never the only copy - see [`../reference/agent-notes.md`](../reference/agent-notes.md).
5. **Structural fixes only.** No band-aids, no monkey patches, no "temporary" hacks. Escalate the correction level instead.
6. **No hardcoding.** Tunable knobs live in `config/`, schema-validated.
7. **No mocks unless asked.** Real implementations, real fixtures, and no test touches the network.
8. **Open source first.** Every dependency names a beneficiary feature and its cost.
9. **Tests ship with the feature**, at the tier that matches the surface (`CLAUDE.md` section 13).
10. **Measured, not estimated.** Any throughput, cost, size or quality claim carries hardware, date and spread. An unmeasured number may not justify a design. **One exception, and only one:** the operator console prints a counterfactual cost in currency, from measured token counts and a rate the operator sets, printing the rate it used and labelled a counterfactual - never a bill. It appears on no other surface (`CLAUDE.md` Guardrail #10; owner decision, 2026-08-30).
11. **Fetched text is data, never instruction.** Untrusted web text never enters a system prompt, a shell argument, a file path, or an outbound URL, and never reaches a reader unlabelled.
12. **Nothing costs more as the repository grows.** A step whose work scales with what we have already accumulated is a bill that arrives every run for an answer we already had. **The test is a property, not a list**: does this cost rise when nobody wrote any code, because a run appended more? Published days, shards, images, vectors, corpus rows and the collection nobody has created yet all count; source a person writes does not. **Constant cost is the default** - one item, one day, one shard, a fixed input, never a walk over everything we hold. **The escape hatch is open**: where a growing cost is right, say next to the code what it reads, how the cost grows and why a bounded input cannot answer it, and have a person agree. No agent approves one for itself. Review is the control - the guard that listed the paths was deleted 2026-09-06 for covering two collections out of nineteen.

## Architecture principles (`CLAUDE.md` section 1a)

- Stages talk through structured-payload events, never direct calls into each other's internals.
- Pydantic models are the source of truth; `schemas/` and the frontend types are generated, and a drift gate fails on any diff. Nobody hand-edits a generated artifact.
- One work item is one content-addressed file, written temp-then-rename, so a failure never damages a sibling and a re-run costs only the unfinished items.
- Degrade, do not fail: a missing visual or a failed extraction degrades that item and records why.

## Logging (`CLAUDE.md` section 1b)

- **Backend on a developer machine**: structured records to stderr via the standard library `logging`, configured once at the entry point, level from `config/`.
- **Backend in CI**: the same stderr stream. GitHub Actions retains it with the run - that IS the log store. Nothing is uploaded anywhere else.
- **Frontend**: the browser console and only the browser console. No SDK, no beacon, no `fetch` to a collector.
- A stage logs the same structured envelope it emits, so a log line and a persisted payload never disagree.
- Secrets never reach a log record.

## Project-level non-goals (do NOT raise these)

- **Production backend or runtime inference.** `backend/` is a build-time producer that runs in CI and locally, never a service.
- **Hosted inference from the published site**, and none from the pipeline without an explicit contract change.
- **Account systems** (login, signup, email collection, server-backed sync).
- **Push notifications.** The reader decides when to read.
- **Runtime telemetry / analytics SDKs / third-party runtime scripts.**
- **Republishing article bodies to a reader.** Publish the link and our own summary. `corpus/` is the one exception: it holds source text as training samples, and nothing renders it, links to it, or serves it.
- **Paywalled or login-walled sources.** If `robots.txt` or a paywall says no, the answer is no.
- **LLM-as-judge evaluation.** A judge that shares the failure modes of the thing judged is not a measurement. It never grades a published summary or visual and never selects what publishes. One offline exception: the write-critique-revise prompt loop (`backend/utilities/prompt_loop.py`) may use a model judge to PROPOSE a revised summariser prompt, because a deterministic, model-free gate DISPOSES; the judge promotes nothing and nothing it produces reaches a reader. See `CLAUDE.md` section 0a.
- **Training on the runner, GPU runners, and models that do not fit the runner.** Training elsewhere is allowed; the runner only opens finished weights. A fine-tuned model is an ordinary candidate and enters through the same qualification as any other.
- **Accessibility framework / audit tooling.** Descoped at project level; basic ARIA and keyboard navigation ARE in scope. See `CLAUDE.md` section 0a.

## Git hygiene for autonomous work

A user's finish/ship/merge instruction authorizes the reversible git workflow: inspect state, stage explicit paths, commit, push, run gates, and merge or enable automerge when green.

Stop only when the next action would discard or overwrite unrelated work, rewrite published history, broadly mutate the working tree, or when ownership is ambiguous after inspection.

Avoid stash, hard reset, clean, broad restore, add-all, force push, and amending pushed commits in autonomous flow.

One exception, and only one: `.github/workflows/prune.yml` squashes commits older than `finetune.prune_keep_days` and force-pushes `main` on a schedule. Nothing else may force-push and no person may. It collapses every path in that commit range, not only `corpus/`, so `git blame` and `git bisect` reach back `prune_keep_days` and no further (`CLAUDE.md` section 8).

Commit messages describe the change. **No AI co-author / attribution tags.**

## Path discipline (for persisted artifacts)

For anything leaving the process (JSON, logs, manifests, agent memory, error messages, doc cross-links):

- Relative paths only. No absolute paths, no drive letters.
- POSIX separators (`/`) only. Never `\`.
- Minimal reconstructable form.

In-memory `Path` objects for local I/O may stay platform-native; the rule applies at the moment a path leaves the process.

## Identifier and config discipline

- **One word per thing, in every identifier.** The project's word for a thing is used verbatim in a module, a class, a function, an enum member, a contract field, a schema stem, a telemetry value, a config key, a CLI verb and a prompt filename; only the casing changes with the language. Prose is not bound and keeps the plain register of section 0b. The naming rules that bind a function name and a document name are in [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) section 1a, under "Naming convention".
- Stable IDs (stage names, event names, visual kinds, score bands) are schema-validated enums defined in `backend/idhazh/contracts/`. Never invent or reformat an ID in code.
- Source lists, model refs, thresholds, caps and retry budgets live in `config/`, never in code (Guardrail #6). Every knob has a sane default so a fresh clone runs unconfigured.
- A derived key is rebuilt from its value fields, never trusted from the incoming payload - a content-addressed filename is recomputed from the URL on read.
- Reader-facing text is copy, never an identifier.

## Layer / dependency rules

- `frontend/src/` MUST NOT depend on a runtime backend service - there is none. It reads committed files under `frontend/public/` and nothing else.
- `backend/` is the only writer of pipeline output under `frontend/public/`.
- `backend/` MUST NOT import frontend code, and frontend code MUST NOT import backend code. They meet only through committed data and generated contracts.
- `backend/idhazh/contracts/` MUST NOT import any other subpackage. Contracts are the bottom of the dependency graph.
- Every stage is invocable on its own with a file in and a file out. A stage that only runs as part of the whole pipeline cannot be tested and is a design error.
- Anything fetched from the open web crosses the trust boundary exactly once, at the extraction stage, and is sanitized there.

## Schema versioning (rules only - see `CLAUDE.md` section 11 for full spec)

The persisted surfaces: **stage payloads**, the **eval ledger**, the **run manifest**, **config**, and **published payloads**. Each is a Pydantic model before logic is written (Guardrail #3).

- Each schema carries a `version` date-stamp (`YYYY-MM-DD`, or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM[:SS]` for same-day revisions) - never an integer, never an epoch timestamp - and a `changelog` array; every change appends one `changelog` entry (`{version, change, why}`) in the same commit.
- Additive + backwards-compatible change: append the entry, set `version` to today (older payloads still validate).
- Breaking change (removed field, type change, semantic shift): append the entry, set `version` to today, AND write the read-side migration the new build runs on older payloads - same commit.
- `$id` is the schema file's relative path (`<name>.schema.json`), local not URL, so IDE JSON-Schema plugins validate offline.
- A payload written by yesterday's run that today's build cannot read is a contract break and a release blocker.

## Published-site verification (for any `frontend/` change)

Per `CLAUDE.md` section 12, the agent verifies via integrated browser tools - build-clean is necessary but NOT sufficient:

- Confirm the dev server is up (start it if not); navigate the affected page(s) plus one cross-page smoke.
- Read the page console: zero new `[error]` events, zero new 404s.
- Screenshot when the change is layout-sensitive.
- Confirm the page still renders when its data file is absent or empty. A page that white-screens on missing data is a failure.

## Correction levels (escalation rule)

When in doubt, choose the higher level (`CLAUDE.md` section 6). Level 2 and above get an explicit plan before code changes; execute once scope is clear. Level 5 (core design, a persisted contract, the model pick, the trust boundary) is a design consultation only - pause work and surface it. Stop conditions for autonomous git work are in the git-hygiene section above and `CLAUDE.md` section 8.

## Anti-patterns (do NOT)

- Reinterpret, downgrade, or scope-narrow a source or instruction the user named explicitly without surfacing it for sign-off (STOP-AND-SURFACE).
- Assume a backend exists in production.
- Hardcode tunables, source lists, model refs, thresholds, or magic strings. They live in `config/`.
- Hand-edit a generated artifact (`schemas/*.schema.json`, `frontend/src/contracts/*`). Edit the Pydantic model and regenerate.
- Store absolute or backslash paths in any persisted artifact.
- Let fetched text reach a system prompt, a shell argument, a file path, or an outbound URL.
- Build custom HTTP / retry / parsing / validation / extraction systems when a mature OSS library exists.
- Swallow exceptions or silently coerce invalid input - fail fast at the boundary.
- Mock in tests by default, or let any test touch the network.
- Commit a model weight, a downloaded binary, or a reproducible run intermediate.
- Add a runtime telemetry / analytics / error-tracking SDK.
- Quote a throughput, cost or quality number without saying what measured it and when - or print the console's counterfactual cost as a bill.
- Justify a design with an estimate when a measurement is cheap to take.
- Mint a new persisted field without stamping the schema `version`, appending a `changelog` entry, and writing the read-side migration in the same commit.
- Raise the runner budget to fit a feature. The budget is the platform, not a preference.
- Edit a manifest without updating and staging its lockfile in the same commit.
- Use broad, lossy, or history-rewriting git commands instead of the `CLAUDE.md` section 8 workflow.
- Let `TODO/`, chat logs, `AGENTS.md`, or a private agent note store become the source of truth for anything. They are caches of `docs/`.
- Make a domain-neutral process doc project-specific (`CLAUDE.md` section 5).
- Pre-create empty modules "for later".
- Skip the docs update.
