# How to execute a plan-doc (the orchestrator contract)

**Last Updated**: 2026-09-11

The step-by-step MECHANICS for running a `TODO/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>-plan.md` that [author-a-plan.md](author-a-plan.md) produced. Authoring writes the plan; this doc runs it. The autonomy POLICY (AUTO by default, when to ESCALATE) lives in [../agents/bootstrap.md](../agents/bootstrap.md); this doc is the HOW.

Run the `bootstrap` skill first. When editing agent/customization Markdown, use ASCII only: "-", "->", ">=", "section".

## The model: an orchestrator that never codes, and disposable workers that do

The agent that runs a plan is an **orchestrator**, not an implementer. It holds only the plan-doc and one report per row, and it NEVER writes feature code inline. Every row's real work is delegated to a **worker subagent** (via `runSubagent`) that runs in its own isolated context and its own git worktree, does the row end-to-end, and returns a structured report. The orchestrator then gates, merges, flips the Status Reckoner, and advances.

Why the split exists: the orchestrator's context is the scarce resource. If it implemented rows inline, its context would fill with per-row detail and it would lose the plan. Delegation keeps the orchestrator lean - it only ever holds the plan + per-row reports, never the full implementation transcript. This is context protection, and it is the whole point.

```
orchestrator (main thread) worker subagent (one per row) persona custom agents
 read plan-doc + Status Reckoner runSubagent(default) per row runSubagent("Fowler...") etc.
 pick next dispatchable row(s) ----> bootstrap; implement the row ----> resolve ONE ambiguity,
 create worktree + branch code + tests + docs return a written ruling
 dispatch worker; mark IN-FLIGHT run Oracle + acceptance gates (an input, not an approval)
 receive structured report <---- consult personas on ambiguity <----
 run DoD + ship-a-pr; merge on green return report (does NOT merge)
 flip Status DONE #pr; distill; advance
```

## Roles

### The orchestrator (main thread) does exactly this, and only this
1. Bootstrap; read the plan-doc Section 0 (operating contract) + Section 1 (Status Reckoner).
2. Select the next dispatchable row(s): every `Depends-on` is `DONE`; rows sharing a `Parallel-group` dispatch together, up to `Parallel N`. Waiting for checks is not a dependency.
3. Create an isolated git worktree off `origin/main` + a named branch per row. Never share a worktree between rows or with a parallel agent (worktree contamination silently sweeps one row's edits into another's PR). Fill the Status Reckoner `Worktree`.
4. Dispatch one worker subagent per row (`runSubagent`, default agent) with a self-contained brief (below). Set `Status = IN-FLIGHT`; fill `Subagent`.
5. Receive the worker's report. Verify its test records and the merge candidate's CI checks against the Definition of Done (CLAUDE.md section 9) and [ship-a-pr.md](ship-a-pr.md). Do not repeat an unchanged worker check. If a merge changes the tested inputs, select checks for those changed inputs. On green gates, remove the row's worktree and then AUTO-merge (`gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`). If checks or publish/deploy jobs are still running for one independent row, keep dispatching other ready rows instead of idling.
6. Flip `Status = DONE #<pr>`; unblock dependents; [distill](distill-a-plan.md) the closed row.
7. Repeat until every row is `DONE` or `COLLAPSED`; then close the plan.

**Between selecting a row and dispatching it, check the row against the tree. Two things, and both take seconds.**

A plan-doc is written before the work and read after the tree has moved under it. Both checks are searches against the current tree, not an entry into the row's implementation - the orchestrator still writes none of the row's code. Both belong to the orchestrator because the fix for either is an edit to the plan-doc, and the plan-doc is the orchestrator's to edit.

1. **Every symbol the row names has to exist.** Search the tree for each identifier, path and command the row's text quotes. A row that names something renamed, moved, or never written sends a worker looking for it, and the worker then either invents a substitute or stops and asks. Both cost a dispatch, and the substitute is the more expensive one because it arrives looking like finished work. When a name is wrong, correct the row before dispatching and say what it was corrected from.

2. **The row's oracle has to be able to fail against the base tree.** Run it before the worker starts. It must fail. An oracle that already passes is measuring something other than the row, and the worker will report a green that proves nothing - so the row closes, the plan records it as settled, and nothing was checked. A row that retires a name is where this bites most often: an oracle phrased as a search for that name matches every place the name still is, so it answers the same before the work and after it, for two different reasons.

Neither check makes a row correct. They establish only that the row can be acted on, and that its result can be told apart from its starting position - which is the same standard `CLAUDE.md` Rule #10 sets for any other measurement.

The orchestrator does NOT open the row's source files, write its code, or run its inner test loop inline - that is the worker's job. The orchestrator's own edits are limited to the Status Reckoner and the merge.

Do not remove or alter a worker's checkout while its tests or build are running.
Closing a plan does not invalidate an existing check. A documentation-only
closure uses documentation checks and CI, not a fresh local application suite.

**Remove the row's worktree BEFORE the merge, and never by detaching it instead.** Removing it first is what frees the branch, so the merge's own branch delete succeeds rather than failing on "cannot delete branch, used by worktree". Detaching frees the branch too, and that is the trap: it throws the branch away, and the branch is the only signal a later sweep can judge the leftover on - a detached checkout whose branch was squash-merged is not an ancestor of the trunk, so it reads as unmerged work and is kept for ever. Measured 2026-09-02, on the merge of the change that first wrote this step down: the tree had to be removed by hand afterwards. If the merge then needs a fixup, the branch is still on the remote and one `git worktree add` brings the checkout back.

**This removal is the step an interrupted run skips, so it cannot be the only defence.** A worker killed mid-row never reaches its own clean-up, and the orchestrator that would have removed the tree has moved on or died with it. Measured on one box on 2026-09-02: 38 abandoned checkouts holding 156,482 files, every one of them a row whose pull request had merged days earlier. `git worktree prune` does not help - it only clears the admin entry for a directory that is already gone, and never deletes a checkout. Pair this step with a sweep the project can run at any time (below).

**When the orchestrator reports to the user, it translates; it does not forward.** A worker writes in the vocabulary of the subsystem it just changed, which is correct for the doc that row updated and wrong for a person asking what happened. Say what each number means next to the number (`CLAUDE.md` section 0b). Forwarding a worker's phrasing is the single easiest way for an orchestrator to break the voice rule while every row underneath it is green.

### The worker subagent (one per row) does the actual work
Dispatched with `runSubagent` (default agent). Its brief is the row verbatim (Scope, Files touched, Acceptance gates, Oracle, Decisions, Rejected alternatives) plus the standing instruction: run bootstrap, honor CLAUDE.md, stay in scope, consult personas on ambiguity, return a report. The worker:
1. Runs bootstrap; reads the row + the docs its surface touches.
2. Implements the row end-to-end: code + tests at the tier that matches the surface (CLAUDE.md section 13) + the docs update.
3. Resolves ambiguity by consulting personas (below), baking the ruling into the code.
4. Runs the row's Oracle and the local checks selected by the project's gate guide. Leaves full-suite checks assigned to CI there; a list of acceptance gates is not an instruction to repeat every CI job locally. Records the tested inputs, selection, result and test counts. An active check is followed to completion, never launched again because its output is quiet.
5. Turns every defect discovered during execution into explicit work: fix it in the row if it is in scope, or record a follow-up row / scope-change item. Do not bury defects in a footnote.
6. Returns a STRUCTURED report: files changed, gate + Oracle results, decisions taken (+ which persona ruled), any ESCALATE, and the branch / worktree state. **The report opens with one plain sentence saying what the row settled, before any table.** A report that opens with a table hands the orchestrator the subsystem's vocabulary, and the orchestrator then forwards it to a person who asked what happened (`CLAUDE.md` section 0b).
7. Does NOT merge, does NOT edit the Status Reckoner, does NOT start another row. Merge and closure are the orchestrator's.

### Persona custom agents resolve ambiguity (they are not an approval gate)
When a row is genuinely ambiguous - a design fork, a contested decision, a fact-finding sweep - the worker dispatches the relevant persona custom agent(s) **by their exact name as listed in CLAUDE.md section 14** (plus "Explore" for read-only breadth) via `runSubagent`. A persona returns a WRITTEN ruling the worker bakes into the row; it is an input to the worker's action, never a request-for-approval surface (bootstrap's AUTO policy). A contested decision runs the relevant personas in DEBATE to ONE ruling (author-a-plan.md step 3).

In VS Code, enable `chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents` in the active
user or workspace settings before asking a worker to delegate. Every custom
agent that delegates must include `agent` in its `tools` list. A prompt with its
own `tools` list must include it too, because that list takes precedence. If an
`agents` list is present, it must allow the requested delegate. Verify the setup
with one real, read-only nested invocation. See
[VS Code's nested-subagent documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/run/subagents#_nested-subagents).

If the harness does not permit a worker to dispatch a nested subagent, the worker instead surfaces the ambiguity in its report; the orchestrator runs the persona consult and re-dispatches the row with the ruling appended to the brief. Reading a persona's file is not a consultation. Either way personas are consulted - never skipped, never treated as a gate.

## The one-line stamp a plan-doc carries

Every plan-doc carries exactly one execution stamp (author-a-plan.md step 5). It is the line that makes "implement it" sufficient: the executing agent reads it, loads this doc, and follows the contract with no further instruction.

```
Execute per docs/how-to/execute-a-plan.md: orchestrator dispatches one worktree-isolated worker subagent per row; workers consult personas on ambiguity; AUTO-merge on green gates; parallel N = <n>; honor the ESCALATE triggers in section 0. AUTHOR-AND-STOP until the user authorizes.
```

Drop the `AUTHOR-AND-STOP...` clause once the user authorizes execution.

## Parallel fan-out

Rows in the same `Parallel-group` are mutually independent and dispatched concurrently, up to `Parallel N` workers, each in its own worktree. A ready row dispatches as soon as its `Depends-on` entries are `DONE`; it does not wait for sibling checks, nor for a long publish or deploy gate on another PR. The orchestrator parallelizes the WORK but serializes the MERGE - one PR at a time, re-checking the next worker's branch against the advanced `main` before its merge - so a green worker never lands on a stale base.

**A plan claiming its parallel rows touch different files is a claim, not a fact.** Compose every wave by diffing the rows' own `Files touched` lists, never by trusting a sentence that asserts they are disjoint. A 33-row plan stated the rule outright and was wrong on its first wave: three rows shared one stylesheet and three components, two more shared one config file, and a sixth row needed a component a row in a later group had not created yet. The evidence was in the plan the whole time - the file lists disagreed with the sentence above them. Where two ready rows do share a file, serialise them and write the new `Depends-on` into the Status Reckoner, so the next wave reads it instead of re-deriving it.

### The workers are parallel; the machine is not

`Parallel N` bounds how many workers WRITE at once. It does not bound what they RUN. Each worker starts its own test suite, its own build and its own browser run the moment it is ready, and on one developer machine those all land on the same cores. Serialise the expensive gates instead - one heavy gate at a time across every worktree, through a lock the project's gate doc names - and leave `Parallel N` where it is, because the writing was never what saturates a box. A gate that finishes in seconds stays unwrapped; serialising a cheap gate only adds waiting.

**A gate that fails only under fan-out is a false red.** A suite that times out while siblings hold the cores has measured the box, not the branch. The tell is that the failing test is byte-identical to the base branch and that the project's CI passed the same commit. Re-run it alone before diagnosing it, and never buy the pass with a raised timeout, an added retry or a relaxed assertion - that hides the contention, and the false red returns at the next fan-out.

**A row that MEASURES runs alone.** Any figure a plan produces - wall clock, throughput, bytes, memory - is a claim about the machine as much as about the change, and a neighbour moves it. Give a measuring row a `Parallel-group` of its own, or hold its arms behind the same lock the gates take. Interleave the arms - base, head, base, head - rather than running one arm and then the other, because box load drifts over the minutes between them and an unpaired comparison then reports the drift. Record what else was running beside the number: CLAUDE.md Rule #10 asks for hardware, date and spread, and on a shared machine the load belongs there too.

## Escalation (when to pause for the user)

AUTO is the default. PAUSE and surface only for: a Level-5 row (CLAUDE.md section 6), a new `## Design rationale` that would change a persisted contract, an unresolved persona conflict, a scope change (-> [handle-scope-change.md](handle-scope-change.md)), or a 3x cost overrun. Otherwise the orchestrator advances without asking.

## Closure

When every row is `DONE` / `COLLAPSED`: run [distill-a-plan.md](distill-a-plan.md) for each closed row, confirm the Status Reckoner is fully resolved, and delete the plan-doc once fully distilled (git history is the ledger, per [../reference/documentation-structure.md](../reference/documentation-structure.md)).

**Then sweep the worktrees the plan created**, with the tool the project's own worktree notes name. Judge each one on three signals and keep it unless all three agree: its pull request is merged, its branch is gone from the remote, and its own tree is clean. All three are needed. A squash merge leaves the branch a non-ancestor of the trunk, so ancestry cannot answer whether the row landed - which is why the pull request is asked. And a branch with no pull request at all is pending work rather than stale work; twice on this project such a branch held a real fix nobody had proposed yet. A detached worktree is the one case ancestry settles alone.

Remove the checkout and keep the branch whenever the branch still holds a commit the trunk does not. The directory is the disk cost; the branch is free and is the only copy of an unmerged commit.
