# How to distill a plan-doc

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-26

The procedure for lifting durable findings out of a `TODO/<date>-<slug>.md` plan-doc into the right canonical home under `docs/`. The plan-doc is the work ledger; once a row closes, anything worth keeping past the merge belongs somewhere else.

## When to run

- After any plan-doc row closes (PR merged + status flipped to `Closed` / `Done`).
- Before declaring an entire plan-doc complete.
- When picking up a stale plan-doc and noticing it has grown rationale narrative that belongs elsewhere.

Do NOT run for in-flight rows. Distillation only happens after the finding has stabilised through merge.

## Inputs

- One closed plan-doc row + its `CLOSED` narrative sub-section (per the [ship-a-pr.md](ship-a-pr.md) 2-commit-then-squash stamp pattern).
- The merged commit SHA on `main` (for cross-reference).

## The routing decision

For each finding in the closed row's narrative, apply the routing rules in [../reference/documentation-structure.md](../reference/documentation-structure.md#routing-rules-decide-a-new-statements-home) and route to ONE home:

| Finding shape | Destination | Example |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Current domain rule, UI shape, tuning invariant, or cross-subsystem vocabulary | **Concept doc** under `docs/concepts/<slug>.md` | "What does this status value mean, wherever it appears?" -> `docs/concepts/` |
| Current shape / layout / contract of one subsystem | **Subsystem doc** under `docs/architecture/<area>/<slug>.md` | "How is this payload laid out on disk?" -> `docs/architecture/<area>/layout.md` |
| Operator runbook / step-by-step procedure | **How-to doc** under `docs/how-to/<verb>-<slug>.md` | "How do I re-run a failed stage?" -> `docs/how-to/` |
| Architecture choice with actively explored rejected alternatives + non-trivial reversal cost + cross-system consequences | **`## Design rationale` / `## Rejected alternatives` section on the impacted subsystem / concept doc** (no ADR file, no `decisions/` dir) | "Why library X instead of library Y?" -> a rationale section on the subsystem doc that owns the choice |
| Agent-only execution lesson (gotcha, recurring trap, tool quirk) | **Agent-notes reference** at `docs/reference/agent-notes.md` | "the cosmetic gh-merge confirmation pattern"; "PowerShell BOM bites `git commit -F`" |
| Per-PR audit trail | **Stays in the plan-doc `CLOSED` sub-section** | Diff stat, gate results, discoveries specific to this PR's execution |

If a finding fits two destinations, pick the living doc that a future maintainer would search first. Do not create a new architecture decision unless the rejected alternative and reversal cost are both concrete. If it fits none, it probably is not durable - leave it in the plan-doc `CLOSED` sub-section and move on.

## What to distill, what to leave

### Distill

- New invariants the PR established (e.g. "every persisted payload carries a `version` date-stamp").
- New architecture rationale only when the PR actively explored and rejected a real alternative with meaningful reversal cost.
- New user-facing behaviour rules ("an item that scored low publishes with a visible marker rather than being withheld").
- New vocabulary the PR introduced or sharpened.
- New operator procedures the PR exposed gaps in.

### Leave in the plan-doc

- The diff stat, the gate results, the merge commit SHA - these are per-PR execution context, not durable knowledge.
- "Discovery" notes that are PR-specific framing of a finding that has already been distilled. The distilled doc is the source of truth; the plan-doc points to it.
- Anything that was distilled by an earlier PR in the same plan. Do not re-distill.

### Leave nowhere (delete from the plan-doc on close)

- In-flight TODO bullets the row resolved.
- Speculative scope-expansion sketches that did not ship.
- Stacked "previous header" status blocks (the plan-doc has a single-snapshot header per [../reference/documentation-structure.md](../reference/documentation-structure.md#plan-doc-single-snapshot-rule)).

## The mechanics

### Step 1 - read the closed `CLOSED` sub-section

For row `X.Y` in plan-doc `TODO/<date>-<slug>.md`, the merge commit landed a sub-section titled `#### X.Y - CLOSED YYYY-MM-DD (PR #NNN)`. List its discoveries, findings, and audit notes.

### Step 2 - route each finding

For each finding, apply the routing table above. Open the target doc; add the finding in the doc's existing tone and structure (do not paste plan-doc prose verbatim - the plan-doc was action-narrative; the target is reference).

### Step 3 - back-reference

In the plan-doc `CLOSED` sub-section, replace the finding's full text with a one-line pointer:

```
- Finding 1: `[now-canonical title](docs/concepts/<slug>.md)` - distilled from this PR.
```

This preserves the audit trail (someone reading the plan-doc later sees what was discovered + where it lives now) without duplicating the content.

### Step 4 - execution lessons go to the agent-notes reference

A finding about _how to do the work_ - a PR-shipping gotcha, a command-line
quirk, a parallelisation trap, a recurring failure mode - goes to
`docs/reference/agent-notes.md`. It is still a doc, reviewed in a PR like any
other.

The line between the two homes is audience, not importance: a living doc answers
"how does this project behave", and the agent-notes reference answers "why did
that command lie to me". Both are in `docs/`, because a lesson kept in an
agent's private memory is invisible to the next person and to the next agent.
Private memory is a cache of what `docs/` already says (CLAUDE.md section 5).

### Step 5 - delete the plan-doc

When the last live row closes and every finding is distilled (steps 1-4), DELETE the plan-doc. Git history - the merge commits, the branch names, `git log --follow <path>` - is the durable "what was tried, in what order, by which PR" record; a finished plan-doc left in `TODO/` is stale clutter a future reader mistakes for live work. The distilled findings in `docs/` are the live knowledge, and this repo is authored by AI agents against git, so the version-control history IS the tree-ring artifact - a second copy in `TODO/` earns nothing.

Before deleting, confirm every durable finding has a canonical home (step 2) and repoint any code comment or doc that cited a plan-doc section to that home, so the deletion leaves no dangling reference.

Confirm the plan-doc is tracked before you plan the deletion as work. A plan-doc that was authored but never committed cannot be deleted by a pull request, and every git question about it answers as though it never existed - which reads like somebody already closed it. `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` gives the answer in one line. The distillation is still owed either way; only the deletion becomes a no-op.

## Anti-patterns

- **Plan-doc as the only home for a finding.** A future agent searching `docs/` for the topic will not find the plan-doc; plan-docs are not browseable knowledge. If the finding is durable, lift it to `docs/`.
- **Re-distillation in a later PR.** Once a finding is in `docs/`, later PRs that touch the same area edit the doc directly. Do not re-lift the same finding from a new plan-doc.
- **Distilling speculation.** Only distill what shipped. A considered approach we did not take goes in a living doc's rejected-experiment note; a costly architecture choice earns a `## Rejected alternatives` section on the doc it impacts, not a separate record.
- **Editorial bloat in the lifted doc.** The target doc gets a sentence or two, not the plan-doc's full narrative. If the lifted text is longer than the doc it joins, you are pasting, not distilling.
- **Skipping the back-reference step.** Without the pointer, the plan-doc reads like the finding vanished. The pointer is a one-liner; do it.
